This repo demonstrates a simple quiz app, created with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. This quiz app asks the user a series of question, displaying visual feedback based on whether or not the answer is correct or incorrect. Sample questions and answers are included in the repo. Thanks to [WebDevSimplified](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=riDzcEQbX6k) for the basis for this project.
